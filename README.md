# Design
## Colour
![Colours](assets/images/readme-img/colours.PNG)

The colour palette is a shade of blue. The main site colour is #a5d4de which was used for a header, navigation bar and a footer background, as well as for a website background color with a nice white-blue gradient. Darker blue #425c81 used in details like buttons' background and social media icons. The lighter colours were used for the hero image, 'About me' text paragraph and buttons. Additionally dark blue #2d3436 was used for the main header, and navigation bar.

## Typography
Fonts were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). 

* 'Great Vibes' font is used for a main header. It is a chic and elegant font which adds an element of artistry to the site.

* 'Spectral' is the font used for a hero image and 'About me' header. I choose slightly italic version of this font which is beautiful and efficient design.

* The main body font is 'Lato'. This font is unique and interesting but simple at the same time. The letters in 'Lato' have some unique curves which are a great match to the artistic side of the page.

* Sans serif is set as a backup if any of the fonts fail to load.
## Icons and Images
1. Icons were sourced from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/). 
* The palette icon was selected to perfectly match the theme of the site. It has also been enlarged to fit the header.

* The social media icons were selected to be easily understable and accessible for every user.
