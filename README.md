# Design
## Colour
![Colours](assets/images/readme-img/colours.PNG)

The colour palette is a shade of blue. The main site colour is #a5d4de which was used for a header, navigation bar and a footer background, as well as for a website background color with a nice white-blue gradient. Darker blue #425c81 used in details like buttons' background and social media icons. The lighter colours were used for the hero image, 'About me' text paragraph and buttons. Additionally dark blue #2d3436 was used for the main header, and navigation bar.

## Typography
Fonts were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). 

* 'Great Vibes' font is used for a main header. It is a chic and elegant font which adds an element of artistry to the site.

  ![Great font](assets/images/readme-img/great.PNG)

* 'Spectral' is the font used for a hero image and 'About me' header. I choose slightly italic version of this font which is beautiful and efficient design.

  ![Spectral font](assets/images/readme-img/spectral.PNG)

* The main body font is 'Lato'. This font is unique and interesting but simple at the same time. The letters in 'Lato' have some unique curves which are a great match to the artistic side of the page.

* Sans serif is set as a backup if any of the fonts fail to load.
## Icons and Images
1. Icons were sourced from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/). 
* The palette icon was selected to perfectly match the theme of the site. It has also been enlarged to fit the header.

* The social media icons were selected to be easily understable and accessible for every user.

* Home page images like the hero image, and quote image were borrowed from [Pexel](https://www.pexels.com/)

# Testing
## Validator Testing
### HTML
* All four pages were tested using the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).  No errors were found.
  * [Home Page](assets/images/readme-img/homecheck.PNG)
  * [Gallery Page](assets/images/readme-img/gallerycheck.PNG)
  * [Contact Page](assets/images/readme-img/contactcheck.PNG)
  * [Thank you Page](assets/images/readme-img/thankyoucheck.PNG)
### CSS
* [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) were used to test the CSS, also shows no errors.
  * [CSS Check](assets/images/readme-img/csscheck.PNG)

## Wave Testing
* Each page was run through the Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/), the initial report showed a few needs for improvement:
  * A heading size was skipped (i.e. there was not a h2), so the h3’s were changed to h2’s on the hero image.
  * The background on the 'About me' paragraph was changed to darker to increase contrast ratio.
  * Screen reader only information  were added for social media icons.
  * Gallery images size were reduced.
* There were still two alerts presented on each page which were ignored as I believe they were significant to the page design:
  * Redundant link - the Contact button on the Hero image and the Contact link on the navigation bar, which I decided to keep, to give users two options to navigate to the contact form.
  * Justified text in the paragraph - it may have negative impact for readability, but I believe justified test looks clean, it is even more readable and clear.
* Score of each pages:
  * [Home Page](assets/images/readme-img/homewave.PNG)
  * [Gallery Page](assets/images/readme-img/gallerywave.PNG)
  * [Contact Page](assets/images/readme-img/contactwave.PNG)
