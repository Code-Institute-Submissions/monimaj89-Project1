# Design
## Colour
![Colours](assets/images/readme-img/colours.PNG)

The colour palette is a shade of blue. The main site colour is #a5d4de which was used for a header, navigation bar and a footer background, as well as for a website background color with a nice white-blue gradient. Darker blue #425c81 used in details like buttons' background and social media icons. The lighter colours were used for the hero image, 'About me' text paragraph and buttons. Additionally dark blue #2d3436 was used for the main header, and navigation bar.

## Typography
Fonts were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). 

* 'Great Vibes' font is used for a main header. It is a chic and elegant font which adds an element of artistry to the site.

  ![Great font](assets/images/readme-img/great.PNG)

* 'Spectral' is the font used for a hero image and 'About me' header. I choose slightly italic version of this font which is beautiful and efficient design.

  ![Spectral font](assets/images/readme-img/spectral.PNG)

* The main body font is 'Lato'. This font is unique and interesting but simple at the same time. The letters in 'Lato' have some unique curves which are a great match to the artistic side of the page.

  ![Lato font](assets/images/readme-img/Lato.PNG)

* Sans serif is set as a backup if any of the fonts fail to load.
## Icons and Images
1. Icons were sourced from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/). 
* The palette icon was selected to perfectly match the theme of the site. It has also been enlarged to fit the header.

  ![Palette icon](assets/images/readme-img/icon.PNG)

* The social media icons were selected to be easily understable and accessible for every user.

  ![Social icon](assets/images/readme-img/icons.PNG)

2. Images 
* Home page images like the hero image, and quote image were borrowed from [Pexel](https://www.pexels.com/)
* Images from carousel and gallery are paintings made and owned by my sister Natalia Michalska and were provided for this website.
## Wireframes
Wireframes were created at the beginning of the design process using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/desktop/).

# Testing
## Validator Testing
### HTML
* All four pages were tested using the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
* On the gallery page one [warning](assets/images/readme-img/warning.PNG) was found.
It was fixed by changing section element to div element.
  * [Home Page](assets/images/readme-img/homecheck.PNG)
  * [Gallery Page](assets/images/readme-img/gallerycheck.PNG)
  * [Contact Page](assets/images/readme-img/contactcheck.PNG)
  * [Thank you Page](assets/images/readme-img/thankyoucheck.PNG)
### CSS
  * [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) were used to test the CSS, and shows no errors.
  * [CSS Check](assets/images/readme-img/csscheck.PNG)

## Wave Testing
* Each page was run through the Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/), the initial report showed a few needs for improvement:
  * A heading size was skipped (i.e. there was not a h2), so the h3’s were changed to h2’s on the hero image.
  * The background on the 'About me' paragraph was changed to darker to increase contrast ratio.
  * Screen reader only information  were added for social media icons.
  * Gallery images size were reduced.
* There were still two alerts presented on each page which were ignored as I believe they were significant to the page design:
  * Redundant link - the Contact button on the Hero image and the Contact link on the navigation bar, which I decided to keep, to give users two options to navigate to the contact form.
  * Justified text in the paragraph - it may have negative impact for readability, but I believe justified test looks clean, it is even more readable and clear.
* Score of each pages:
  * [Home Page](assets/images/readme-img/homewave.PNG)
  * [Gallery Page](assets/images/readme-img/gallerywave.PNG)
  * [Contact Page](assets/images/readme-img/contactwave.PNG)
  * [Thank you Page](assets/images/readme-img/thankyouwave.PNG)

## Lighthouse Testing
### Lighthouse testing was performed using [Google Chrome Lighthouse](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk) extension.
* Desktop
  * [Home Page](assets/images/readme-img/hemodes.PNG)
  * [Gallery Page](assets/images/readme-img/gallerydes.PNG)
  * [Contact Page](assets/images/readme-img/contactdes.PNG)
  * [Thank you Page](assets/images/readme-img/thankyoudes.PNG)
* Mobile
  * [Home Page](assets/images/readme-img/homeperf.PNG)
  * [Gallery Page](assets/images/readme-img/galleryperf.PNG)
  * [Contact Page](assets/images/readme-img/contactperf.PNG)
  * [Thank you Page](assets/images/readme-img/thankyouperf.PNG)

  The performance on the home page on a mobile device is not quite what I wish it was. I tried to compress the hero image, which then unfortunately loses quality. Considering that my site is an artistic site, I came to the conclusion that the quality of the presented images is more important than the page loading speed, which by the way is not the worst.

### Improvements to the Lighthouse score:

* Converted all images into webp format and compressed sizes to speed up loading times.
* Placed all scripts files into bottom of the body rather than in the head, so most important content was loaded first.

## User Testing
|   Target      |   Outcome     | Image |
| ------------- |-------------| -----------|
| 1. Header navigates to main page.  | The header is clickable and will redirect to the home page from any other page. | ![Header](assets/images/readme-img/header.PNG) |
| 2. Easy and clear navigation throught all pages.|Navbar is conveniently located at the top of every page and the links are clearly visible. Each link navigates to the correct page. Users are already familiar with the hamburger menu, so they will know its functions. |![Nav](assets/images/readme-img/navham.PNG) |
| 3. Easy contact. | Additionally added in the center of the hero image contact button, which will navigate to the contact page. |![Button](assets/images/readme-img/button.PNG) |
| 4. Get in touch through social media.  |Font Awesome social media icons placed in the footer, each one opens in a new tab, and has a hover effect.|![Socialmedia](assets/images/readme-img/footericon.PNG) |
| 5. Acknowledgement that the query has been received. | After submiting the query, user is directed to the 'Thank you' page, acknowledging their query has been received | ![Thankyou](assets/images/readme-img/thankyou.PNG) |
| 6. Being able to visit site on every device. | The page has been designed responsively (including using a hamburger navbar) to ensure the site is accessible on any device. Content changes to displaying two items in one line in desktop, to displaying one per line on mobile. |![Desktop](assets/images/readme-img/lgscreen.PNG) ![Mobile](assets/images/readme-img/mobile.PNG) |


# Bugs
| Bugs       | Solved?   | How? |
|------------|-----------|------|
| 1. Footer on the contact page  | Yes | The page did not have enough content, so the footer was displayed in the middle of the page. I found solution on the [CSS Tricks Page](https://css-tricks.com/couple-takes-sticky-footer/). |
| 2. Carousel images on the desktops were too stretched and didn't look good. | Yes    |   I've asked for help on the [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and was advised to add object-fit: contain property to my CSS, which centered images and make them look better. |
| 3. Images not displaying on my home page | Yes | I've changed absolute file path to the relative path. |
| 4. On the landscape view, the text on the quote overflows the image. [See here](assets/images/readme-img/bug.PNG) | Yes | I've added position: relative to the parent, and absolute to the child.

3. The green Gitpod button was pressed to open a new workspace/development environment (obtain the gitpod extension to enable the green button).
4. Git is used to commit during development and push this over to Github
5. To create the hosted site at Github Pages, I navigated to the Github repo settings tab and found the Github pages dedicated section.
6. The main branch was chosen in the dropdown menu and the 'save' button was pressed. This supplied a live link to the [website](https://monimaj89.github.io/Project1/).

### To run locally
